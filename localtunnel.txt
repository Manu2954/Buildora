Demo Guide: Making Buildora Public with Localtunnel
This guide contains the complete, corrected instructions for making your application public for a demo.

Step 1: Install Localtunnel
Open a terminal and run this command to install localtunnel globally:

npm install -g localtunnel

Step 2: Start Your Local Servers
Start Backend: In one terminal, run node server.js inside your backend folder.

Start Frontend: In a second terminal, run npm start inside your frontend folder.

Step 3: Create Frontend .env File (Critical Fix)
This step tells your frontend app what the public backend URL is.

In the root of your frontend directory, create a new file named exactly .env.

Add the following line to this new file, pasting the public backend URL you will get from localtunnel.

REACT_APP_API_URL=https://buildora-api-demo.loca.lt

Step 4: Update All Frontend Service Files
You must now update all of your service files (storefrontService.js, authService.js, orderService.js, etc.) to use this new environment variable.

Open each service file and change the API_BASE_URL line to look like this. This makes your code work for both local development and the public demo.

Example (storefrontService.js):

// Use the public URL from the .env file, or fall back to the proxy for local dev.
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL ? `${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/api/storefront` : '/api/storefront';

// ... rest of the service file

You must apply this pattern to every service file in your frontend/src/services directory.

Step 5: Configure Backend CORS
This step tells your backend server to trust requests coming from your public frontend URL.

Install CORS (if you haven't):

npm install cors

Update server.js: Open your backend's server.js file and add the following corsOptions:

// server.js
const cors = require('cors');
// ...
const corsOptions = {
    origin: [
        'http://localhost:3000', // For local development
        'https://buildora-live-demo.loca.lt' // The public URL for your FRONTEND
    ],
    credentials: true,
};
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
// ...

Step 6: Run Tunnels and Restart Servers
Restart Both Servers: After making these code changes, stop both your frontend and backend servers (Ctrl+C) and restart them.

Run Tunnels: Open two new terminals and run the following commands:

Backend Tunnel:

lt --port 5000 --subdomain buildora-api-demo

Frontend Tunnel:

lt --port 3000 --subdomain buildora-live-demo

Test: Open your public frontend URL (https://buildora-live-demo.loca.lt) in your browser.

With these changes, the CORS error will be resolved, and your demo will work for remote users.
